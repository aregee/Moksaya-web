Moksaya - WebInterface :

==================================================================================================

Web Interface for project Moksaya <https://github.com/aregee/moksaya/> written witn Angularjs.


###Setup:
First you need backend , RESTful server Moksaya written in Django which is linked above.
Follow the instrustions in Moksaya for setting up the backend and running it.
By Default Moksaya runs on 8000 port.
   
   $ node web-server.js  


This would start another webserver at localhost:8080, point your browser to this address and there would be a login view waiting for you.



###Tip:
This is a experimental commit mostly just a proof of concept so there is no signup form yet , follow the instructions in Moksaya <https://github.com/aregee/moksaya/> to register a new user and run Test to populate the database.
You can use this webapp to login with the created users and check the list of all projects available in the database.
